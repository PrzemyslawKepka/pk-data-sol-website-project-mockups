This is a helper repository for my main repo, where I store the code for my portfolio website

/Users/przemyslawkepka/Desktop/GIT_NEW/pk-data-sol

And crucial part of the website is Projects section, where I list and thoroughly
describe projects that I have done so far in my professional career.

/Users/przemyslawkepka/Desktop/GIT_NEW/pk-data-sol/src/content/projects

For open source projects, websites or side projects, I can easily produce
screenshots showcasing real project or data.

However, I also list my corporate project there, and these are bound by NDAs, meaning that I cannot share any images from the real projects.

And as I think that the images are pivotal to showcase the projects, while at the same time I don't want to generate any fake images through AI, I've decided that I will produces 'mockup images', showcasing some dummy information, but reflecting the real project.

Therefore the purpose of this repo is to generate one-off python scripts that will generate content for images I want to use for my projects.

Examples:
- Project showcasing excel automation - I want to create a python script generating an excel file, which will contain information relevant to the project
- Powerpoint automation - python script generating PowerPoint file
- Bank statement PDF automation - python script generating PDF file
- Streamlit project - python script creating Streamlit app

Technical note: 
We use venv here, so once a new package is introduced then please update the requirements file
