A helper, one-off repository to create scripts that will generate screenshots for my portfolio website, stored separately at: https://github.com/PrzemyslawKepka/pk-data-sol-website

Some of the projects that I cover were done under NDAs, meaning that I cannot share any code or screenshots. 

But to still represent them visually somehow, AI-generated scripts will create an output resembling real project, but they will not cover any confidential data.

Generation logic and examples are described in `CLAUDE.md` file.
